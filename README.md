I am planning to build a Resume that I will use to apply to a variety of internships at several different roles across many companies this is just a log of my Journey as I apply changes and edits to better meet the needs of the recruiters. I make 
such documents on overleaf so this is justgoing to be a directory from which I can learn and build using LateX.
