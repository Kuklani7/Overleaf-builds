\textbf{Dear Hiring Manager,}

I am excited to apply for the Software Engineering Internship because of your focus on building scalable, reliable systems that power real-world applications. During my internship, I developed React-based dashboards to monitor inventory levels and built SQL-driven logging workflows to analyze PLC runtime faults, improving how engineers diagnosed production issues. Additionally, through my work as an Algorithms Teaching Assistant, I have regularly optimized code for runtime and memory efficiency, strengthening my ability to write robust and efficient applications.

As a Teaching Assistant for Algorithms and Complexity, I regularly debug and optimize student implementations involving graph theory and dynamic programming across domains such as routing, web crawling, and resource allocation. Working extensively with C/C++, pointer arithmetic, and manual memory management trained me to think like a systems engineer focused on minimizing memory leaks and improving runtime efficiency through careful design and analysis.

During my internship at Kuksons Electronics, I standardized PLC programs and built a centralized error-logging database that improved root-cause analysis speed by 35\% across manufacturing lines. This experience also led me to collaborate on a patented AI-driven web content personalization system, where I developed a responsive React and TypeScript interface that improved user retention by 27\%.

In a personal project, I engineered a Dual-Dimension Graphics Engine using Vulkan that sustained 60+ FPS in multi-object scenes through an optimized rendering pipeline. I implemented scalable animation systems and applied object-oriented design in Java and C++ with Box2D to improve frame consistency by 35\% in physics-intensive environments.

I am excited to contribute to T-Mobile’s Traditional Out-Of-Home (OOH) platform, where modern UI and APIs drive real-world impact. At Kuksons Electronics, I built React dashboards and a PostgreSQL logging system that improved visibility and troubleshooting, directly aligning with UI and workflow development. As an Algorithms Teaching Assistant and through C/Linux projects, I strengthened my debugging and problem-solving skills, preparing me to thrive in T-Mobile’s agile engineering environment.
